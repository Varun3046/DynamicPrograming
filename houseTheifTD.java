/*
There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. 
A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side.
What is the maximum stolen value?

Examples:

Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output: 19
