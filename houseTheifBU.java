/*
There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?

Examples:

Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output: 19

// Java program to find the maximum stolen value 
import java.io.*; 
  
public class GFG  
{ 
    // Function to calculate the maximum stolen value

      dp[hval.length] = 0;

      for(int i= hval.length-1;i>=0 ;i--)
      {
          dp[i] = Math.max(hval[i]+ dp[i+2] , dp[i+1]);
      }

        System.out.println("Maximum loot value : " + maxLoot(hval)); 
    }
